## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a **unified taxonomy structure** that enables AI systems to accurately classify coins and better connect buyers and sellers in the age of artificial intelligence. 

**The core innovation is standardized coin IDs** - consistent, parseable identifiers that make machine learning and database operations reliable. By providing these stable identifiers along with comprehensive metadata, this database serves as a foundation for:

- **AI-powered coin identification** and classification systems
- **Automated marketplace matching** between buyer needs and seller inventory
- **Price analysis and market research** with reliable historical data
- **Numismatic education** through structured, validated information

## Overview

This project provides a machine-readable taxonomy of United States coins with:

- **Standardized coin IDs**: Every coin has a consistent `COUNTRY-TYPE-YEAR-MINT` identifier (e.g., `US-INCH-1877-P`, `US-LWCT-1909-S`) that can be reliably parsed by software systems
- **Complete series coverage**: All major US coin denominations from cents to dollars
- **Detailed mintage data**: Business strikes and proof mintages from authoritative sources
- **Key date identification**: Coins marked by rarity status (key, semi-key, scarce, common)
- **Variety tracking**: Major overdates, doubled dies, and mint errors properly separated from main coin IDs
- **Composition periods**: Accurate metal content through time
- **Source attribution**: Citations from PCGS CoinFacts, NGC, Red Book, US Mint records

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Data Coverage

- **20 major series** across 5 denominations
- **99 individual coin entries** with full attribution and standardized IDs
- **39 key dates** identified with rarity status
- **33 major varieties** documented with descriptions

### Database-First Architecture

The SQLite database serves as the source of truth, with JSON files for version control:

1. **Migration scripts**: Version-controlled schema and data definitions (source of truth)
2. **SQLite database**: Generated build artifact optimized for queries and analysis
3. **JSON exports**: Generated files for distribution and compatibility

**Important**: The `database/coins.db` file is treated as a **build artifact** and is not committed to git. Developers generate their local database by running the migration scripts.

### Validation and Quality Control

- JSON Schema validation ensures data consistency
- Automated testing of all coin data files
- Source citation tracking for data verification

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mattsilv/coin-taxonomy.git
   cd coin-taxonomy
   ```

2. **Set up the development environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   uv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   # or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   uv add jsonschema
   ```

3. **Generate the database:**
   ```bash
   # Generate local database from migration scripts
   uv run python scripts/migrate_to_universal_v1_1.py
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   # Test that validation works
   uv run python scripts/validate.py
   
   # Verify database structure
   uv run python scripts/check_db_structure.py
   ```

## Development Workflow

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Never edit JSON files directly! They are generated artifacts.

### Data Flow
```
JSON Files  ‚Üí  Database  ‚Üí  JSON Exports
 (source)     (build)       (generated)
```

**IMPORTANT**: The database is a **build artifact** - it's generated from the JSON source files and should not be committed to git.

### Complete Database Rebuild Process

The canonical way to rebuild the entire system from source:

```bash
# Full rebuild - use this for clean deployment
uv run python scripts/rebuild_and_export.py
```

This comprehensive script:
1. üóëÔ∏è **Removes existing database** (`database/coins.db`)
2. üìñ **Initializes database from JSON data** (`scripts/init_database_from_json.py`)
3. üîÑ **Runs universal migration** (`scripts/migrate_to_universal_v1_1.py`)
4. ‚úÖ **Validates data integrity** (`scripts/data_integrity_check.py`)
5. üìÅ **Exports JSON files** (`scripts/export_db_v1_1.py`)
6. üß™ **Validates exports** (`scripts/validate.py`)
7. üåê **Copies universal data to docs folder** for GitHub Pages

### Making Changes
1. **Update JSON source files**: Edit denomination files in `data/us/coins/*.json`
2. **Rebuild everything**: `uv run python scripts/rebuild_and_export.py`
3. **Verify changes**: Check that data integrity passes
4. **Commit JSON files**: `git add data/ docs/data/ && git commit`
   - ‚úÖ **DO commit**: JSON source files and exports
   - ‚ùå **DON'T commit**: The database file (`database/coins.db`)

### Coin ID Format: The Foundation of Everything

The **coin ID** is the most critical identifier in this database. It serves as the primary key that connects all data across systems and makes AI-powered coin identification possible.

#### Why Coin IDs Matter

In the age of AI and automated marketplaces, **consistent, parseable identifiers** are essential for:

- **AI coin identification**: Computer vision systems need reliable IDs to match photos to database entries
- **Marketplace integration**: E-commerce platforms require predictable formats to connect buyers and sellers
- **Price analysis**: Historical tracking and valuation requires stable, unique identifiers across time
- **Database reliability**: SQL queries and joins depend on consistent ID structures

#### Standard Format: `COUNTRY-TYPE-YEAR-MINT`

**Component Definitions:**

1. **COUNTRY** (2-3 letters): ISO-style country code
   - `US` = United States
   - `CA` = Canada  
   - `GB` = Great Britain
   - Future: `FR`, `DE`, `JP`, etc.

2. **TYPE** (4 letters): Standardized 4-letter series abbreviation identifying the coin design/series
   
   **Cents:**
   - `INCH` = Indian Head Cent
   - `LWCT` = Lincoln Wheat Cent  
   - `LMCT` = Lincoln Memorial Cent
   - `LBCT` = Lincoln Bicentennial Cent
   - `LSCT` = Lincoln Shield Cent
   
   **Nickels:**
   - `SHLD` = Shield Nickel
   - `LHNI` = Liberty Head Nickel
   - `BUFF` = Buffalo Nickel
   - `JEFF` = Jefferson Nickel
   
   **Dimes:**
   - `BARD` = Barber Dime
   - `MERC` = Mercury Dime (Winged Liberty Head)
   - `ROOS` = Roosevelt Dime
   
   **Quarters:**
   - `BARQ` = Barber Quarter
   - `SLIQ` = Standing Liberty Quarter
   - `WASH` = Washington Quarter
   
   **Dollars:**
   - `MORG` = Morgan Dollar
   - `PEAC` = Peace Dollar
   - `EISE` = Eisenhower Dollar
   - `SANT` = Susan B. Anthony Dollar
   - `SACA` = Sacagawea Dollar

3. **YEAR** (4 digits): The year the coin was minted
   - `1877`, `1909`, `1942`, `2024`

4. **MINT** (1-2 letters): US Mint facility where coin was produced
   - `P` = Philadelphia
   - `D` = Denver
   - `S` = San Francisco
   - `CC` = Carson City (historical)
   - `W` = West Point
   - `O` = New Orleans (historical)

**Examples:**
- `US-INCH-1877-P` = US Indian Head Cent, 1877, Philadelphia mint
- `US-LWCT-1909-S` = US Lincoln Wheat Cent, 1909, San Francisco mint  
- `US-MERC-1942-D` = US Mercury Dime (Winged Liberty Head), 1942, Denver mint

**Validation Rules:**
- **Exactly 4 parts** separated by **exactly 3 dashes**
- **All uppercase letters** (no lowercase allowed)
- **No variety information** in the coin_id (goes in `varieties` array instead)
- **Consistent abbreviations** across all series

#### What This Enables

With standardized coin IDs, developers can:
- **Parse components**: `coin_id.split('-')` reliably returns `[country, type, year, mint]`
- **Query predictably**: `WHERE coin_id LIKE 'US-INCH-%'` finds all US Indian Head Cents
- **Filter by country**: `WHERE coin_id LIKE 'US-%'` finds all US coins
- **Join tables safely**: Foreign key relationships work consistently across systems
- **Build integrations**: APIs and services can depend on the format

#### Common Mistakes (Now Prevented)

‚ùå **Invalid formats** that break parsing:
- `INCH-1864-P-L` (missing country prefix, variety in main ID)
- `US-LWCT-1909-S-VDB` (5 parts - VDB goes in `varieties`)
- `US-MERC-1942-P-21` (5 parts - overdate info goes in `varieties`)

‚úÖ **Correct format** with variety data properly separated:
```json
{
  "coin_id": "US-INCH-1864-P",
  "varieties": [
    {
      "variety_id": "INCH-1864-P-L-01", 
      "name": "L on Ribbon",
      "description": "Designer's initial L on ribbon"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Data Structure

### Universal Currency Taxonomy (v1.1)

As of v1.1, this project supports a **Universal Currency Taxonomy** that can accommodate coins and banknotes from any country and time period. The system uses a flat, normalized structure that replaces the previous nested format while maintaining full backward compatibility.

#### Database-First Architecture

The SQLite database (`database/coins.db`) serves as the **single source of truth**. All JSON exports are generated from the database:

```
database/coins.db (source of truth)
    ‚Üì (export via scripts)
data/us/coins/*.json (legacy format - backward compatibility)
data/universal/*.json (new universal format)
```

#### Universal Tables

The new v1.1 schema includes these core tables:

**`issues` table**: Flat structure for all currency items
- Universal issue IDs (e.g., `US-LWCT-1909-S`)
- Country-agnostic denomination and authority data
- JSON fields for specifications, design details, mintage data

**Registry Tables**: Normalized reference data
- `subject_registry`: People, symbols, design elements (8 entries)
- `composition_registry`: Alloy definitions (8 standard compositions)  
- `series_registry`: Series metadata across all countries

#### Dual Export Formats

**Legacy Format** (`data/us/coins/*.json`): Preserves existing nested structure
```json
{
  "country": "United States",
  "denomination": "Cents",
  "series": [
    {
      "series_name": "Lincoln Wheat Cent",
      "coins": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Universal Format** (`data/universal/*.json`): New flat structure
```json
{
  "country_code": "US", 
  "total_issues": 97,
  "issues": [
    {
      "issue_id": "US-LWCT-1909-S",
      "object_type": "coin",
      "issuing_entity": {...},
      "denomination": {...},
      "specifications": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Issue ID Generation

The universal system uses human-readable, standardized issue IDs:

**Format**: `{COUNTRY}-{SERIES_ABBREV}-{YEAR}-{MINT}[-{VARIETY}]`

**Examples**:
- `US-LWCT-1909-S` - 1909-S Lincoln Wheat Cent
- `US-MERC-1916-D` - 1916-D Mercury Dime  
- `US-WASH-1932-D` - 1932-D Washington Quarter

**Generation Logic**: 
- Country code (ISO-style)
- Series abbreviation (first 3 chars of series_id, uppercase)
- Year, mint mark, optional variety identifier

### Complete Taxonomy File

For convenience, a complete US coin taxonomy is available in a single file:
- **Location**: `data/us/us_coins_complete.json`
- **Content**: All denominations, series, and coins in one unified structure
- **References**: Includes resolved composition data and all reference files
- **Generation**: Updated via `scripts/export_us_complete.py`

This file combines all individual denomination files with resolved composition references, making it easy to access the entire taxonomy without loading multiple files.

### Series Information

Each coin series includes:

- **Basic metadata**: Official name, years of production, designers
- **Physical specifications**: Diameter, thickness, edge details
- **Composition periods**: Metal content with date ranges
- **Complete mintages**: Business strikes and proof production with unique identifiers

### Individual Coins

Each coin entry contains:

- **Unique identifiers**: Stable coin_id fields for programmatic access
- **Mintage figures**: Separate business_strikes and proof_strikes quantities
- **Rarity classification**: Key date status (key/semi-key/scarce/common)
- **Variety arrays**: Structured variety information with variety_id fields
- **Source attribution**: Citation to authoritative numismatic sources
- **Additional notes**: Context about significance or special characteristics

### Example Entry

```json
{
  "coin_id": "US-MERC-1916-D",
  "year": 1916,
  "mint": "D",
  "business_strikes": 264000,
  "proof_strikes": null,
  "rarity": "key",
  "source_citation": "PCGS CoinFacts",
  "notes": "King of Mercury dimes"
}
```
