# United States Coin Taxonomy Database

A comprehensive, structured database of US coin series, mintages, varieties, and key dates from 1859 to present.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a **unified taxonomy structure** that enables AI systems to accurately classify coins and better connect buyers and sellers in the age of artificial intelligence. By providing standardized, machine-readable coin data with consistent identifiers and comprehensive metadata, this database serves as a foundation for:

- **AI-powered coin identification** and classification systems
- **Automated marketplace matching** between buyer needs and seller inventory
- **Price analysis and market research** with reliable historical data
- **Numismatic education** through structured, validated information

## Overview

This project provides a machine-readable taxonomy of United States coins with:

- **Complete series coverage**: All major US coin denominations from cents to dollars
- **Detailed mintage data**: Business strikes and proof mintages from authoritative sources
- **Key date identification**: Coins marked by rarity status (key, semi-key, scarce, common)
- **Variety tracking**: Major overdates, doubled dies, and mint errors
- **Composition periods**: Accurate metal content through time
- **Source attribution**: Citations from PCGS CoinFacts, NGC, Red Book, US Mint records

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Data Coverage

- **20 major series** across 5 denominations
- **105 individual coin entries** with full attribution
- **39 key dates** identified with rarity status
- **33 major varieties** documented with descriptions

### Database-First Architecture

The SQLite database serves as the source of truth, with JSON files for version control:

1. **Migration scripts**: Version-controlled schema and data definitions (source of truth)
2. **SQLite database**: Generated build artifact optimized for queries and analysis
3. **JSON exports**: Generated files for distribution and compatibility

**Important**: The `database/coins.db` file is treated as a **build artifact** and is not committed to git. Developers generate their local database by running the migration scripts.

### Validation and Quality Control

- JSON Schema validation ensures data consistency
- Automated testing of all coin data files
- Source citation tracking for data verification

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

## Data Structure

### Universal Currency Taxonomy (v1.1)

As of v1.1, this project supports a **Universal Currency Taxonomy** that can accommodate coins and banknotes from any country and time period. The system uses a flat, normalized structure that replaces the previous nested format while maintaining full backward compatibility.

#### Database-First Architecture

The SQLite database (`database/coins.db`) serves as the **single source of truth**. All JSON exports are generated from the database:

```
database/coins.db (source of truth)
    â†“ (export via scripts)
data/us/coins/*.json (legacy format - backward compatibility)
data/universal/*.json (new universal format)
```

#### Universal Tables

The new v1.1 schema includes these core tables:

**`issues` table**: Flat structure for all currency items
- Universal issue IDs (e.g., `US-LWC-1909-S-VDB`)
- Country-agnostic denomination and authority data
- JSON fields for specifications, design details, mintage data

**Registry Tables**: Normalized reference data
- `subject_registry`: People, symbols, design elements (8 entries)
- `composition_registry`: Alloy definitions (8 standard compositions)  
- `series_registry`: Series metadata across all countries

#### Dual Export Formats

**Legacy Format** (`data/us/coins/*.json`): Preserves existing nested structure
```json
{
  "country": "United States",
  "denomination": "Cents",
  "series": [
    {
      "series_name": "Lincoln Wheat Cent",
      "coins": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Universal Format** (`data/universal/*.json`): New flat structure
```json
{
  "country_code": "US", 
  "total_issues": 97,
  "issues": [
    {
      "issue_id": "US-LWC-1909-S-VDB",
      "object_type": "coin",
      "issuing_entity": {...},
      "denomination": {...},
      "specifications": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Issue ID Generation

The universal system uses human-readable, standardized issue IDs:

**Format**: `{COUNTRY}-{SERIES_ABBREV}-{YEAR}-{MINT}[-{VARIETY}]`

**Examples**:
- `US-LWC-1909-S-VDB` - 1909-S VDB Lincoln Wheat Cent
- `US-MD-1916-D` - 1916-D Mercury Dime  
- `US-WQ-1932-D` - 1932-D Washington Quarter

**Generation Logic**: 
- Country code (ISO-style)
- Series abbreviation (first 3 chars of series_id, uppercase)
- Year, mint mark, optional variety identifier

### Complete Taxonomy File

For convenience, a complete US coin taxonomy is available in a single file:
- **Location**: `data/us/us_coins_complete.json`
- **Content**: All denominations, series, and coins in one unified structure
- **References**: Includes resolved composition data and all reference files
- **Generation**: Updated via `scripts/export_us_complete.py`

This file combines all individual denomination files with resolved composition references, making it easy to access the entire taxonomy without loading multiple files.

### Series Information

Each coin series includes:

- **Basic metadata**: Official name, years of production, designers
- **Physical specifications**: Diameter, thickness, edge details
- **Composition periods**: Metal content with date ranges
- **Complete mintages**: Business strikes and proof production with unique identifiers

### Individual Coins

Each coin entry contains:

- **Unique identifiers**: Stable coin_id fields for programmatic access
- **Mintage figures**: Separate business_strikes and proof_strikes quantities
- **Rarity classification**: Key date status (key/semi-key/scarce/common)
- **Variety arrays**: Structured variety information with variety_id fields
- **Source attribution**: Citation to authoritative numismatic sources
- **Additional notes**: Context about significance or special characteristics

### Example Entry

```json
{
  "coin_id": "MD-1916-D",
  "year": 1916,
  "mint": "D",
  "business_strikes": 264000,
  "proof_strikes": null,
  "rarity": "key",
  "source_citation": "PCGS CoinFacts",
  "notes": "King of Mercury dimes"
}
```

### For Numismatists  

We welcome contributions to expand this taxonomy beyond United States coins. If you have expertise in coins from other countries and are interested in contributing to create a truly global numismatic taxonomy, please feel free to reach out.

The v1.1 universal structure makes it straightforward to add:
- **International currencies** from any country or time period
- **Historical monetary systems** (pre-decimal, non-standard)
- **Banknotes and paper currency** with minimal schema changes
- **Complex authority relationships** (regime changes, successions)
