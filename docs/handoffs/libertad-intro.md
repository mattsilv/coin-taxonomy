# Mexican Libertad Bullion - Initial Research

> **⚠️ NOTE**: This document contains preliminary research from dealer sources (Felix Kirzhner compilation).
> **For implementation, use the validated canonical data in `libertad-research1.md`** which reconciles all conflicts and provides authoritative mintage figures from comprehensive primary sources.

## Overview

The most liquid, highly tradable Mexican Libertad bullion coins are as follows: Gold Libertads have been issued most consistently in the 1 oz size from 1981 to present (with interruptions in the 1990s and restarting in the early 2000s). Silver Libertads began in 1982 and have been produced annually to present, especially in the 1 oz size.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]

### Year Ranges – Gold Libertad (Bullion)
- Most liquid: 1 oz gold coins, issued:
  - 1981 (first year, very high mintage)
  - 1991–1994 (annual, lower volumes)
  - 2000, 2002–present (steady annual issuance)[9][4][1]

### Year Ranges – Silver Libertad (Bullion)
- Most liquid: 1 oz silver coins, issued:
  - 1982–present (continuous annual production, large investor interest)[3][5][7][8]

### Key Points for Implementation
- Focus on the 1 oz gold (1981, 1991–1994, 2000, 2002–present) and 1 oz silver (1982–present) Libertads for maximum liquidity and tradability.[4][5][1][3]
- Smaller denominations exist but are less liquid in global trade.
- Proof and fractional types are not considered bullion for core taxonomy use.

This summary represents the core bullion coin year ranges for gold and silver Libertads, ideal for taxonomy systems targeting mainstream liquidity.[5][1][3][4]

Libertads
by Felix Kirzhner
The Libertad coins are silver and gold bullion coins minted by the Mexican Mint. Libertads are devoid of face value, yet are legal tender, still accepted as currency and guaranteed by Banco de México based on the market value of its gold or silver content.

In addition to the bullion version, a proof and reverse proof versions for both metals are manufactured specifically for collectors. Proof coins contain a frosted angel with a polished background. A reverse proof is the opposite and has a polished angel with a frosted background. An antique finish silver Libertad coin was first released in 2018 with a limited mintage of 40,000.

2015 1oz gold Libertad (Stack’s Bowers auction, 26 May 2021, lot 60360)

The reverse design used was based on the 1921 gold Centenario, a coin issued to mark the centennial of Mexican independence. The winged Victoria of Angel of Independence is in front with the volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl in the background. The older Libertad coins show a front-facing view of the angel. The new Libertad series shows a three-quarter side profile of the angel. The gold used the older angel from 1981 through to 1999. The silver used the older angel from 1982 through to 1995.

The obverse shows the Mexican coat of arms. In 2000, the obverse was changed to depict the current Mexican national coat of arms along with ten past versions of this symbol surrounding it.

Gold coins have not changed sizes since first minted. From 1982 through to 1995, the ¼, ½, and one ounce silver coins had slightly smaller diameters and greater thicknesses than current minted coins. From 1981 through to 1990, the gold coins contained 90% gold (.90 fineness). The gold coins since 1991 and all silver coins have contained 99.9% silver or gold (.999 fineness).

In 1989, 3,500 ¼ ounce Libertad platinum coins were produced.
