# Schema Alignment & Three-Cent Pieces Update (v2.1.0)

**Date:** 2025-09-04  
**Version:** 2.1.0  
**Issues:** #50, #57  
**Type:** Major Update with Breaking Changes

## Summary

This release adds Three-Cent Pieces to the taxonomy and fixes critical schema alignment issues between the database and export scripts. The pre-commit validation system has been redesigned to be less brittle and follow single source of truth principles.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes

### Export Column Mappings
The following column mappings have changed in export scripts:
- `series` â†’ `series_id` in AI taxonomy export
- `variety` â†’ `varieties` in all exports  
- `country_code` â†’ `country` in universal export

### Test Structure Changes
- GitHub Pages tests now expect `coins` array, not `series`
- Tests check for `series_id` field, not `series`
- Universal export warnings are now non-blocking

### Removed Features
- Category/subcategory columns (not present in current schema)
- Hard-coded category validation
- Seller/marketplace functionality (out of scope)

## New Features

### Three-Cent Pieces (#50)
Added 51 Three-Cent Pieces to the database:

**Silver Three-Cent Pieces (26 coins)**
- Type I (1851-1853): 6 coins, 75% silver, no star outlines
- Type II (1854-1858): 5 coins, 90% silver, three star outlines
- Type III (1859-1873): 15 coins, 90% silver, two star outlines

**Nickel Three-Cent Pieces (25 coins)**
- Years: 1865-1889
- Composition: 75% copper, 25% nickel
- All Philadelphia mint

### Schema Alignment Fixes (#57)
- Fixed export scripts to use actual database columns
- Established database as single source of truth
- Removed assumptions about non-existent columns

### Improved Pre-commit Validation
- Less brittle, follows single source of truth (database â†’ JSON)
- Better error messages with actionable guidance
- Non-critical checks show warnings instead of failing

## Migration Instructions

### For JSON File Consumers

Update your code to check both old and new field names:

```javascript
// Old way
const series = coin.series;

// New way - backward compatible
const series = coin.series_id || coin.series;
const varieties = coin.varieties || coin.variety;
```

### For Database Users

The core `coins` table schema remains unchanged. New Three-Cent coins use these IDs:
- Silver: `US-TCST-YYYY-M` (e.g., `US-TCST-1851-O`)
- Nickel: `US-TCNT-YYYY-M` (e.g., `US-TCNT-1865-P`)

### For CI/CD Pipelines

Update your tests and validation:
1. Check for `coins` array instead of `series` in us_coins_complete.json
2. Test for `series_id` field instead of `series`
3. Pre-commit hook warnings for universal export are now non-blocking

## Data Updates

- **Database:** 51 new Three-Cent Pieces added (609 total coins)
- **New JSON file:** `data/us/coins/three_cents.json`
- **Updated:** All export scripts to use correct schema

## API Changes
